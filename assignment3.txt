The pipeline uses Hugging Face’s transformers and datasets libraries to fine-tune a pre-trained bert-base-uncased model on IMDb for binary sentiment classification. It first loads the IMDb dataset using datasets.load_dataset, automatically partitioning into train and test splits. Tokenization leverages the AutoTokenizer for bert-base-uncased with truncation and padding to prepare input batches compatible with BERT’s requirements. Fine-tuning is performed using Hugging Face’s Trainer, allowing systematic training and evaluation with GPU acceleration if available. Evaluation uses accuracy and F1-score to measure the model’s performance comprehensively. The fine-tuned model is saved locally, and the pipeline demonstrates how to reload it for inference on new sample texts using pipeline for streamlined prediction.

Key challenges anticipated include GPU memory limitations on Colab, requiring smaller batch sizes, and handling longer text truncation which can affect sentiment capture. These are addressed by limiting max_length, using DataCollatorWithPadding, and subsampling for quick prototyping. This design ensures reproducibility, clarity, and alignment with best practices in transfer learning for NLP.
